## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd TaskChain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env` with production values:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@ep-xxx.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=<generate-with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))">

# Stellar Mainnet
STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon.stellar.org
STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015

# Platform Escrow
ESCROW_ACCOUNT_ID=GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Step 3: Run Pre-Deployment Checks

```bash
# Dry run to check configuration
DRY_RUN=true npx tsx scripts/deploy-mainnet.ts
```

This will verify:
- All required environment variables are set
- JWT_SECRET is strong enough
- Stellar network is configured for mainnet
- Database connection works
- Escrow account is valid
- No testnet configuration present

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations
npx tsx scripts/migrate.ts
```

This will create all required tables including:
- User tables
- Escrow tables
- Critical operations table (fail-safe)
- Emergency withdrawal tables

### Step 5: Build Application

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Step 6: Initialize Security Systems

The deployment script will automatically initialize:
- Fail-safe system
- Emergency withdrawal system

### Step 7: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Confirm deployment
CONFIRM=true npx tsx scripts/deploy-mainnet.ts
```

This will:
- Run all pre-deployment checks
- Execute database migrations
- Build the application
- Initialize security systems
- Validate the deployment
- Generate deployment report

### Step 8: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Or use the Vercel dashboard to deploy from GitHub.

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Health Checks

```bash
# Check application health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Check database connection
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/db

# Check blockchain connection
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/blockchain
```

### 2. Functional Testing

Test critical functionality:
- [ ] User registration and authentication
- [ ] Job creation
- [ ] Escrow funding (small amount)
- [ ] Milestone creation and approval
- [ ] Fund release (small amount)
- [ ] Escrow refund (small amount)
- [ ] Dispute creation
- [ ] Emergency withdrawal (test)

### 3. Security Validation

- [ ] Verify all endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Verify CORS is restricted
- [ ] Verify security headers are set
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Verify error messages don't leak information

### 4. Monitoring Verification

- [ ] Verify logs are being collected
- [ ] Verify errors are being tracked
- [ ] Verify alerts are configured
- [ ] Verify dashboards are working
- [ ] Verify on-call notifications work

---

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Emergency Withdrawal

If funds are stuck in escrow:

1. Create emergency withdrawal request:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/emergency/withdrawals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -d '{
    "contractId": "contract-id",
    "reason": "Smart contract bug",
    "amount": "1000",
    "currency": "USDC",
    "recipientAddress": "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }'
```

2. Get 3 of 5 emergency signers to approve

3. Wait 48-hour time delay

4. Execute withdrawal

### 2. Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

1. Revert to previous deployment:
```bash
vercel rollback <deployment-url>
```

2. Restore database from backup:
```bash
# Contact Neon support for point-in-time recovery
```

3. Verify rollback was successful

4. Investigate failure

5. Fix issues and redeploy

### 3. Circuit Breaker Activation

If system is under attack:

1. Activate circuit breakers via admin panel
2. Stop all new transactions
3. Investigate attack
4. Patch vulnerabilities
5. Gradually resume operations
